# Assignment - React Native Application

## Assumptions:

1. The slug is the ID, this is just an assumption which I made based on the
   other APIs where the slug is used as ID for POST requests

## Additional Info:

1. I have used Axios and Redux Thunk as that is what the assignment instructed
   me to do but if I had a choice and there was no preference I would use Redux
   Toolkit to reduce boilerplate code
